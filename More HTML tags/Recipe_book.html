        <p><strong class="step1">Step 1:</strong> Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p>
        <p><strong class="step2">Step 2:</strong> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>

        <p><strong class="step1">Step 1:</strong> Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter.</p>
        <p><strong class="step2">Step 2:</strong> Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.</p>
        <p><strong class="step3">Step 3:</strong> Set a medium frying pan or crêpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Serve with lemon wedges and caster sugar, or your favourite filling. Once cold, you can layer the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to 2 months.</p>

        <p><strong class="step1">Step 1:</strong> In medium bowl, beat egg with wire whisk until fluffy. Stir in remaining ingredients just until flour is moistened (batter will be slightly lumpy); do not overmix or pancakes will be tough. For thinner pancakes, stir in additional 1 to 2 tablespoons milk</p>
        <p><strong class="step2">Step 2:</strong> Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375°F). (To test griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray before heating).</p>
        <p><strong class="step3">Step 3:</strong> For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. Turn; cook other side until golden brown.</p>
